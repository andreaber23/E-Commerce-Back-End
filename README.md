- Install Dotenv package. It stores sensitive data, like a userâ€™s MySQL username, password, and database name (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Usage
After installing all the packages, open mysql to create the database. Type the following:

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ecommerce_db;
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
